[As promised]({% post_url 2016-06-06-2.7-3.0-and-beyond %}), the majority of the changes are housekeeping-related, with a few significant (read: breaking) API changes to help with usability and future-proofing as JS evolves.

## API Changes and Migration

- Functions with a `function(i, ele)` signature are now `function(ele, i)` [#1531](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1531)
  - Affects: `eles.each()`, `eles.bfs()`, `eles.dfs()`, `eles.filter()`, `eles.positions()`, `eles.layoutPositions()`
  - It's now simpler to use ES6 syntax for operations on elements! Example:

  ```javascript
  // v2
  cy.elements().each(function(i, ele){
    console.log( ele.id() + ' is ' + ( ele.selected() ? 'selected' : 'not selected' ) );
  });
  // new v3 syntax; we can ignore the index i
  cy.elements().each(ele => console.log( ele.id() + ' is ' ( ele.selected() ? 'selected' : 'not selected' ) ) );
  ```

- `cy.layout()` and `eles.layout()` now return the layout (rather than chaining the calling object) [#1533](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1533)
  - Any code which previously ran a layout by calling `eles.layout( opts )` or `cy.layout( opts )` should be changed to `eles.layout( opts ).run()` or `cy.layout( opts ).run()`.

- `this` is no longer modified for many callbacks [#1535](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1535)
  - Affects:
    - `eles.each()`
    - `eles.filter()`
    - `eles.positions()`
    - `eles.layoutPositions()`
    - `eles.bfs()`
    - `eles.dfs()`
    - `eles.dijkstra()`
    - `eles.aStar()`
    - `eles.bellmanFord()`
    - `eles.kruskal()`
    - `eles.floydWarshall()`
    - `eles.pageRank()`
    - `eles.closenessCentrality()` and `eles.closenessCentralityNormalized()`
    - `eles.betweennessCentrality()` and `eles.betweennessCentralityNormalized()`
    - `eles.degreeCentrality()` and `eles.degreeCentralityNormalized()`
    - concentric and cose layouts (already deprecated)
  - Avoiding changing `this` in the bodies of functions (keeps the `this` context from outside the function) makes
  [working with arrow functions nicer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#No_bindingof_this).
  - Example:

  ```javascript
  // Cytoscape.js v2.x
  cy.nodes().each(function(i) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      this.addClass('highlighted', 500);
    }
  });
  // Cytoscape.js v3.x
  cy.nodes().each((ele, i) => {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      // `this` is no longer modified to be the element of interest for many callback functions
      ele.addClass('highlighted', 500);
    }
  });
  ```

- `cy` prefix has been removed from names of event fields [#1537](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1537)
  - For example, `event.cyTarget` is now `event.target`. `event.cyTarget.id()` would now be `event.target.id()`.

- A clearer distinction is made between `display`, `visibility`, and `opacity` in the internal API, bringing them in line with the HTML/ CSS counterparts [#1544](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1544)
  - **Only applies to internal APIs**
  - `display`, `visibility`, and `opacity` refer to whether an element takes up space, whether an element is visible, and whether an element is interactive.
  - `display`: Whether to display the element; may be `element` for displayed or `none` for not displayed.
  - `visibility`: Whether the element is visible; may be `visible` or `hidden`.
  - `opacity`: The opacity of an element, ranging from 0 to 1. The opacity of a compound node parent will also affect children.

  | Property | Takes up space | Bundled bezier edges take up space | Visibility of connected edges | Interactive
  |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-
  | `display: none` | no | no | hidden | no
  | `visibility: hidden` | yes | yes | visible | no
  | `opacity: 0` | yes | yes | visible | yes

- The `:touch` selector has been removed [#1540](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1540)
  - It's less reliable now that browsers are implementing touch APIs without hardware support.
  This means that the `:touch` selector will sometimes report that touch is supported even when the user's device lacks touch capabilities.

- `cy.onRender()` and `cy.offRender()` have been replaced with the `render` event [#1541](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1541)
  - `cy.onRender(fn)` becomes `cy.on('render', fn)`
  - This allows render events to be used with `cy.once()` when only a single trigger is desired.

- The `grab` event has been broken into two parts: `grab` and `grabon` [#1545](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1545)
  -  `grab` now refers to *all* elements that are currently being grabbed (such as during a drag). `grabon` refers to the element that the user's mouse/ finger is over while grabbing the elements.

- The jQuery plugin has been removed [#1539](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1539)
  - When used as a jQuery plugin, no reference to the graph was returned. Having no reference to the graph made using the API more difficult and was an unnecessary source of mistakes for beginners.
  - It's still possible to pass a jQuery element to Cytoscape.js during initialization, but Cytoscape.js will no longer register itself as a jQuery plugin.

  ```javascript
  // v2
  $('#cy-div').cytoscape(...)

  // v3
  cytoscape({ container: $('#cy-div'), ... })
  ```

- `cy.load( ... )` was deprecated in v2 and has been removed in v3 [#1534](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1534)

  ```javascript
  // v2
  cy.load( ... );

  // v3
  cy.elements().remove();
  cy.add( ... );
  cy.layout( opts ).run(); // note that .run() is also new to v3
  ```

- `layout()` and `scratch()` mapper support was deprecated in v2 and has been removed in v3 [#1536](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1536)
  - Old: `'scratch(foo)'`
  - v3: `function(ele) { return ele.scratch('foo') }`

- `initRender()` has been removed after deprecation in v2 [#1538](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1538)
  - Instead, use a combination of `cy.one()` and the `render` event.
  - For example, `cy.one('render', () => console.log('initial render'))`

- The `inhibitor` arrow shape has been removed [#1655](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1655)
  - The shape was never publically documented (and had an incorrect name).

- `cose` no longer bundles the Weaver dependecy [#1687](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1687)
  - Cose is the only included layout with a dependency; its removal allows for a smaller file size.
  - A Thread polyfill is included for cose to use during layouts if Weaver is not provided as an external script.
  - To use multitasking, include a reference to Weaver in the `weaver` property of the layout options.
  - Example:

  ```javascript
  var Weaver = require('weaverjs')
  var options = {
    name: 'cose',
    weaver: Weaver
    // ... remainder of options
  }
  cy.layout( options ).run();
  ```

- Graphs extensions (including layout extensions, such as cola and dagre; and UI extensions, such as qtip) may need to be updated to their latest versions to work with the API changes [#1718](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/1718)
  - Additionally, the new versions of these extensions are backwards-compaible with 2.x.
  - Affected layout extensions: arbor, cola, cose-bilkent, dagre, spread, springy
  - Affected UI extensions: automove, cxtmenu, edgehandles, navigator, panzoom, qtip

## Example migration from v2 to v3

  var grabCount = 0;
  cy.nodes().on('grab', () => {
