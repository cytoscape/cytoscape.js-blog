Cytoscape.js 3.27.0 has been released.  This version brings with it several new features:

- The `z-index` property now allows for floating point values and negative values ([#3160](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/3160)).
- The `preset` layout now supports the `spacingFactor` option ([#3172](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/3172)).
- The new `edge-distances: endpoints` style property value allows for more precise control of edge placement, especially for edges that aren't centred about their connected node centre points ([#3157](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/3157)).

Special thanks go out to [Akash Mondal](https://github.com/AkMo3), who contributed the automation process that generated this release.  His contributions will help to streamline future releases.

The full list of changes can be found in the [3.27.0 milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.27.0).
